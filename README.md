# Weather Checker Application
## About this project-
This is a basic project to present the current weather forecast from each city in the world.
In addition, the app provides also the user's weather and time zone automatically. 

## Usage 
I developed the application in a Python environment (all the installations are in a .toml file using Poetry) and is presented 
by the Streamlit package.
The data is transferred automatically using the OpenWeatherMap api.
